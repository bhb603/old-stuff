# Active Record Lite

This is a lite implementation of the Rails Active Record we all know and love.

From the [Rails Guides](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html):

> Active Record is the M in MVC - the model - which is the layer of the system responsible for representing business data and logic.
